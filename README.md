# hybrid-PSO-optimizer

## Description

This project is an implementation of a custom optimizer using PyTorch's `torch.optim.optimizer`. The optimization algorithm is a hybrid of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The primary purpose of this project was for my Evolutionary Computation course evaluation.

## Installation

To use this optimizer, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- PyTorch 
- NumPy
- torchvision
- matplotlib 

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib torchvision
```
